# odin landing page project

## Description

This is the final project of the Foundation/CSS part of the Odin's Project. It asked us to build a web page from scratch which should looks exactly like a picture given. It serves the purpose of practicing:

1. HTML basic
2. CSS basic (Styling, Flexbox, etc.)

Hopefully, I can finished this right away and soon enter the Javascript part.

## The Process

In the process, it appears that "Roboto", the font used in the project is not defaultly installed on the macOS. I have to downloaded them from Google Fonts and manually installed them.

The site is finished using the given style, with the name [All About Sheep](https://ryunosuke.tech/all-about-sheep-page/)! Check if you like it!

## Unresolved Problems

The **font-weight:lighter** in the Quote section doesn't appear correctly. Possible reason the online font doesn't have lighter attribute value.
