# odin-landing-page

This is the final project of the Foundation/CSS part of the Odin's Project. It asked us to build a web page from scratch which should looks exactly like a picture given. It serves the purpose of practicing:

1. HTML basic
2. CSS basic (Styling, Flexbox, etc.)

Hopefully, I can finished this right away and soon enter the Javascript part.
